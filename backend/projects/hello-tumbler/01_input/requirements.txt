Create a simple Python CLI application called "hello-tumbler" that:

1. Prints a colourful ASCII art banner on startup
2. Accepts a --name flag (default: "World")
3. Prints "Hello, {name}! Welcome to Code Tumbler."
4. Includes a pytest test suite that verifies the greeting logic
5. Has a pyproject.toml with project metadata

Keep it simple — one source file, one test file, and a pyproject.toml.
